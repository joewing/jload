JLoad
==============================================================================

System load average display for JWM.  This program is intended to be used
in JWM trays via the "Swallow" tag, though it can be used without JWM as
a substitute for xload.

Unlike xload, JLoad displays a normalized load average (the load average
divided by the number of CPU cores).  In addition, it allows one to
specify a command to execute when clicked.
